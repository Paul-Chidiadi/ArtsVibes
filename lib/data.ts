        i was never meant to say anything.
        i was supposed to watch the fruits
        grow in the garden full of snakes.
        i was bitten today.  yesterday,
        i took a cyborg to my country
        for sightseeing & told him to zip
        his mouth about the rotten
        fruits. his cheeks still hold
        a warning tag from the last visit.
        at the lab, wanting to hide the scar,
        i told the prosthetic to cover
        the cyborg’s cheeks with my country's
        coat of arm—the eagle on the top
        & the two horses posing on both sides.
        i understand little about dishonesty
        but i know the genesis of surviving
        in the realm of a political nightmare
        is to eat from the rotten fruits
        or embrace the holiness of silence.
        i & the cyborg—since we arrived
        my country, have been fasting,
        abstaining from our blue-coated tongue.
        when it was time for the cyborg
        to depart home, i formatted his memory
        because the ears between politics & truth
        is deaf & i do not want another cyborg's chip to rust.
        i swear, i do not want to blame my countrymen
        but who hasn’t eaten from the garden, me?`,

        The thin line between love and hate pitched
        Its tent in your eyes on the day the phoenix

        I remember you crushing little rocks against your
        Shadowed cave of a body in a bid to exonerate your
        Conscience from the flames of a mass of dancing fire.
        My mother used to tell me that hatred is no friend of
        Any man. Now I not only immerse myself in the ice lakes
        Of the territory, I also steal some warmth from the fireplace;
        I not only enjoy the swish and swoops of the tingling air, I also
        Communicate with the ancient pillars of the earth. These four
        Elements altogether no longer bear grudges with one another in
        My world, just like the way the words from my poetry hug and

    I sit in a history class, my teacher teaches colonialism, imperialism and terrorism
    Terrorist with names and skin color like mine, not so black, yet still black
    It brings me back to the state of my country
    The divide, across religion, ethnicity and class
    My Igbo friend still laments about Biafra
    My christian friend talks about terrorist attacks
    He says it as though he's being targeted simply for not being Muslim
    He says "Boko Haram" with so much disgust as though their actions describes all Muslims
     
    I wish I could tell him,  that I too am a victim, that Muslims too are victims
    In my hometown 30 people were  burnt alive
    That just like Deborah another Muslim was KILLED for blasphemy
    A victim of jungle justice
    I wonder if it's still terrorism if they attack people with names, faces and religion like theirs
     
    In my country we carry trauma like our birthright
    Each religion finding blame
    Each tribe pointing fingers at another
    Intense divide, stereotypes and tribal wars
    Hausas are Aboki, uneducated and almajiri's
    Yorubas are extreme and loud
    Igbos are cheats who love money
    Arguing which is greater, Hausa, Yoruba or Igbo
     
    While doing so we forget that Nigeria is more than that
    It's home to more than 500 languages and 300 ethnic groups
    And  we're all connected, it's all the same
    Stereotyping NIgerians is alot like trying to fit an ocean in a tea cup or
     containing a wildfire in a single match or even trying to bottle up the brilliance of a rainbow
     
    To be  Nigerian is to embrace a beautiful mosaic of diversity
    where each piece contributes to the richness of our identity
    A constant reminder of the heritage that runs through our veins
    -ONE NIGERIA- is more than a chant and greater than a dream
    It's a generation trying to bridge the gaps between words and emotions,
    Attempting to capture the vastness of love in a single label - NIGERIAN-
    Breaking down barriers like a flowing stream, fostering diversity and promoting unity
    Tribes and religions intertwined, weaving a fabric that's one of a  kind
     
    Each step we take, each action we choose, holding the power to shape the future
    And contribute to the healing and growth of our nation
    Years from now, when stories are shared of past struggles and how we repaired. 
    The tales of ethnic fights and intolerance will seem like distant echoes, lost in the expanse,
    Generations to come will find it hard to believe, that such divisions and conflicts were once conceived,
    For we will have built bridges, strong and true
    In this future we envision, when generations hear of our past
     They'll find it hard to believe, because it's no longer a reality
    As we gaze ahead to the future, history casts its gaze upon us, and the present rests in our hands.`,

                        —February 18, 2022, Vanguard News

    I've never seen God more closely
                        than in the eyes of the man who gives

    a penny of softness to a boy.
                        The man lifts the windows of his imaan

    & offer his hand into what
                        another will call sadaqah.
                        
    Even in stillness, it doesn't take
                        much to understand how it is enough to

    heal the hunger of the boy
                        & his fragile body. It takes more than

   one stretched hand to name kindness.
                        I have live here for a while, & this is how

    I remind myself the city’s tenderness
                        is only the unfolding of its landscape.

    Its blue winged history perching on
                        everything it touches.The scent of the

    air thickened with the blood 
                      & scent of its people. Boned-dusk in the
                      
    voice of the adhaan—gathering a
                        congregation of believers. The boy is
                          
    sitting in front of the mosque. His bowl,
                        tied with a rope, is still craves what will

    quench its new thirst. I am searching
                        for windows that open to love in my pocket.

    I, too, have grown to envy what my hand
                        could offer. Like the boy, I, too, prefer

    a god who makes no promise
                        beyond the one that says at the end

    of my misery, there's a door the size
                        of the hand that will do the opening.

    “The Zamfara state police command said the terror group,

    –Daily Trust (Wed, 4 Dec 2024 )

                                            what does survival feels like for you? 
    
    i have seen what it looks like to carry the grave 
    as a hollowed heartbeat. outside my window,
    bullets are flying around; blood is swallowing the
    city whole. yesterday, the parents of the girl who
    had my mother’s eyes visited our house, to take a photograph
    of my mother; to help identify their daughter’s corpse from
    a hundred others piling the market square like bags of millet.
    i muttered prayers, wondering if God heard them. 
    somehow, i believe God still hears
    though our cries never made it to his ears.
    
                                            won’t you run out of the city for your safety?
    
    iya wajen da gudu ya kaimu shine kabari,
    the distance between us and escape is a bullet away. 
    everywhere is an unopened tab in the website of doom. 
    the Lakurawa people threaten to kill any farmer who visits their field. 
    schools are closed, markets shut down. 
    the only moving thing roaming the city 
    is hunger, and a silence that sings back to itself. 
    
                                            what have you witnessed in the body of the smoke when the bomb strikes?
    
    na gan jini, kogin jini.
    flood of blood. of children wallowing in 
    the helplessness of fate. children feeding on the 
    innocence of tears. their fucked breaths causing
    traffic in the oesophagus of bliss. children leaping like frogs. 
    confluence of silence. women menstruating in fire. 
    women pregnant with the cosmos of rust. prayers. 
    wingless prayers. prayers damned by the holy hands of gravity.
    i saw regret in the eyes of an almajiri boy who lay two limbs incomplete,
    blaming faith or fate or perhaps, both; for his misfortune. 
    
    
                                            what does escape taste like?
    
    it tastes the mesmerizing voices of ghosts. 
    it tastes like silence. 
    it tastes the sacrificial egg in the calabash of djinns. 
    it tastes like a mother bathing her son’s corpse with tears.
    it tastes the voice of a three year-old boy shouting to his
    father’s remains  baba ka tashi, ka tashi muje gida baba
    before the bullet silenced him into a slow fade.

    In Samaru. I worship the distance and its silent guilt covered
    by the arc of bullets. I think about the cold grieving of the dead
    which I know, not by name but as a place I pass through

    never happened (to me), until it did, with its sharp, shocking verb,
    the verbosity of the wounds that followed, blood transcending flesh

    Light falls through a woman’s veil, and I pick them up 
    with both eyes. There is a realm below the clouds;
    a bus melts away in its arms. 
    The veiled woman is hawking grace, so I swallow 
    my haggling tongue as she greets me with a village
    beside her smile. She is speaking the language my mouth 
    does not understand. The driver who carried ghosts inside his stories
    about the north, throws an insult into the skin of Kontagora.
    Its breath crashes by the roadside. Theory says it was
    murdered by petals: too much of beauty can drown a spirit.
    I say it’s grace: drought has lost the map to this place.
    I trace the footprints of angels in her tongue; she speaks of her people
    as stars. She speaks of a hope that stings darkness on its cheek.
    The sky a polygraph nods in consensus. 
    I kiss her palm before the bus turns its back on her.
    Tradition says it is what to do when you find grace— leave it 
    on your lips. When we run into three cities fathered by the same consonant,
    I imagine God chuckling at the sight of Adam’s northern accent, 
    as he touches these blue cities, say Kaduna say Kano say Katsina.
    I imagine my country burning on His lips as he divides the land,  
    the brown cake, and blesses Arewa with the largest chunk.
    I say it’s grace. And I am dizzy from kissing it into memory.

    of worth in the current: the sheen on the coins
    
    subject to rust. I am no expert in the date business,
    in the margin of the profit, but often, I catch Muntari
    
    fingering through the heap for the juiciest Khandari dates,
    the ones plump but faintly wrinkled, stuffing them
    
    into the cupped palms of waiting boys. Once a customer
    stopped by his absent neighbour’s pile of dates.
    
    One would think, and rightly so, that it is fair game
    to hawk down on the chance, clench claws on the client
    
    Call it naiveté & Muntari would scarcely pay any mind,
    but like a gingered apprentice, he transacted on behalf
    
    of his neighbour, tucked the cash in the bands around
    the barrow, & returned empty-handed to his shed.
    
    Or so one would think. That his hands must always be empty, 
    until you watch him pushing his barrow steadily 
    
    
    into the crimson sunset, a halo around his figure 
    like a vignette, with boys in the angwa trailing him
    
    offering to push, tender hands  in his callused palms,

    because I am everything this land raised me to be.

    My home cradles loved men,

    The one thing they love more than God Himself
    is being right—
    even when it’s wrong.

    The morning adhaan cuts through the haze,
    its call threading through the fog

    Still, they gather—their shoulders draped in soft cloth,
    feet bare against the cold ground,
    breath visible as they move forward,
    their prayers, rising with the mist.
    Tea kettles hum over coal fires,
    their steam curling upward,
    a quiet offering to the waking sky.

    The air, thick with dust and devotion,
    holds its stories in the cold;
    each step toward the mosque
    etches faith against the blur of dawn.
    
    This is home—
    a land of sunrises and traditions,
    where harmattan humbles and heals,
    where every voice rises like poetry,
    strong against the winds of time.
    The people stand like millet

is the only consequence of birth, of twinging
carefully like prayers stranded in an alms bowl.
I'm afraid of the things familial with language:
my father first, and his attempt to live briefly
inside the minutes of a flying bullet.
Then a small-sized mulch of hope,
flaying like harmattan at the northern edge
of harm. I bet the sky has done us numbers.
Maybe the 000 hours of wutar dare only fall
as crackles, grace and grief in a broken man's
kettle. How many amin should I carry in my
soul and not feel the burden of a stranger
in my hometown? Sing me the road to Papiri,
sing it softly, for I want to be happy.
Replace me with the old records of smoke:
Suya. Kilishi. Durbar. And the teething
laughter of the smallest unit of a kitchen fire.
I still wake with the same measured exits
of absence. Sometimes I'm only Hausa
because I'm pretending to be loved,
held close to the last meal before a mother's
hand grows cold. Things are running out
of hand, yet home has called me welcome
an awful million times. Once, a man asked
me where I am from. I gave him my body.
At least the body is never a fig tree of its
own history. It carves its skin in the sight
of blood and sand. I hope one day I'll be
saved by light even knowing the sinfulness
of this scorching sun. My dreams are still
valid and beautiful, still knowing how to
wait under a baobab tree for those little
moonlight stories that once made me whole.

if not brief interruptions in the silence of the world,
would our breath have returned itself to dust? sometimes,
I think we are just the divergence of a memory we do not
remember being born into. or maybe we are a borrowed
history, wearing our skin like a borrowed coat. our unspoken
grief standing quietly at the back of the throat. & we call it
"identity." don't you know that even the word trembles
when you press it too hard? if you ask me who we are,
I will tell you we are a thousand unfinished prayers
braiding themselves into our spines. we are the broken
metaphors hidden under the tongue because the world
taught us fear before longing. aren't we the fingerprints
of strangers who loved us before we learned to name them
ancestors? we are the shadows of children still searching
for language in the rubble of their first heartbreak: the heat
of the broken glass still warm in their palms. a child pocketing
broken syllables from the floor the way other children pocket
marbles. maybe we are just the soft ache between two breaths
waiting for someone to call it "belonging." we are a body
of doubts searching for a language that can baptize us
into meaning. maybe we are just a procession of metaphors
learning to survive inside a wound. I think we are the aftertaste
of history. I agree, there is no place like home, even smoke
knows how to fold back into the air & call that disappearance
a homecoming. I think we are the children of a brutal tenderness:
carving our bones into a metaphor & never teaches us how to stop
shaking. if you press a stethoscope to our future, you will hear a choir
of trembling & a brief flicker of consciousness between two eternities
of nothing. & look how we still try to call this little flicker: life.

ina kwana, lafiya kalau.  ya ke jiya, lafiya kalau.
ya kwana biyu, lafiya kalau.  ya kake,
lafiya kalau.  ya gidanku, lafiya kalau—

petaled smiles and blue optimism, kindness of a stranger paying your transport fare
and softness dressed in kaftans, hijabs, and jalabiya. I, a child of water,
a nyamiri far from home, can’t help but marvel in this language fluently
spoken. Here, peace, the lushness of morning when the muezzin braids the air
with prayer. I walk through it like someone searching for the mouth of a river,
hoping that gentleness can be carried southward like birds swimming in the wind.
But my country refuses to soften. It holds its wound the way a mother holds a child.
Everywhere I turn, the news is another body, another city learning how to set itself
on fire. How do you tell a nation to breathe when its lungs are full of smoke?
I wish the calm this place now holds could spill over the map, pour itself
into the cracks of our broken mornings, the same way women pour water
at their doorsteps at dawn to settle dust. But peace is only a visitor here.
It sits with us, drinks kunu, laughs, touches our cheeks with cool fingers,
and when night comes, it packs its small bag and walks away. And yet,
I keep looking northward, hoping that if I name this softness enough times
it might grow wings, might descend on the places where boys run with fear
threaded to their shadows and girls learn to pray with half-closed mouths.
I am learning that love, too, is a country, one forever on the brink of burning,
yet I stand in its fields, gathering every gentle thing I can find like someone
saving light for a future that refuses to arrive.

open your mouth.
shine a light down the corridor of old vowels.

we are brushing the dust off buried syllables,
sifting through the sediments of borrowed tongues,
looking for the sound that belonged to us
before somebody footnoted it, italicised it,
filed it under "native dialect"
in some office that has never tasted our sun.

but the shovel hits my father's silence—
that small, disciplined cough
he rehearsed before offering his name
to the man in the crisp uniform.
as if one wrong consonant could
cost him something tender.

and isn't that our world?
where "K-K-Kano" catches in the BBC broadcaster's throat
because our cities never fit their grammar.
where a border drawn in a fogged room
far from the dust of our markets
became a scar we now walk along barefoot.

we are the names bent out of shape in the archive—
"Bello" flattened into "Bellow",
"Gbenga" declawed to "Benga".
to speak of our ancestors now is to rinse
the registrar's ink from the wounds of our tongues.

and yes, we are contradictions—
children raised in the blast radius
who still argued this morning about
whose jollof was definitive.
(this, too, is a way to survive:
to insist on flavour in a mouth full of ash).

so who are we?
the paint peeling like a prophecy off the secretariat wall,
history flaking straight into our palms,
the harmattan stripping the bricks clean,
searching for the mud beneath the government gloss.

we are not your fixed answer.
we are the question stretching its limbs,
the throat clearing itself after generations of dust,
after centuries of being mispronounced.

Savoury, the sweet hours of bargaining.
The world stood still.
So still you could see the market alive & glorious;
fresh fishes from river gasping for home,
meaning, anything is liable to displacement.
Beside the fish seller stall,
a vegetable seller preaches the miracle
that holds a withered water leaf in a pot of soup.
As if to prove Joy Harjo's theory
that the world begins at a kitchen table.
That even a dead thing could be given life in the kitchen.
I am one of her believers haggling the price of a dead thing to be revived.
Somewhere else, a pepper seller curses a woman
who haggled his price down by half.
The world focuses on his anger
forgetting the calamity that the mouth holds.
Forgetting we are all bounded by the curse of the creator;
the gunmen will come again & the traders will forsake their goods for safety.
At the end, a mother would not return. Or a mother would return
with a bruised body and a dead child in her hand.
A family will count their loss in multitude.
I will carry the burden of death in my basket
in place of yam tubers. The gun will continue to do its work.
I will be among those who devote their life to Psalm 91,
pleading to be salvaged from the snare of the fowler.

We are the echo between languages,

names carried on tongues that no longer remember their weight.

Our mothers taught us silence as survival,
our fathers taught us laughter that hides the bruise.

We walk through dust that once had kingdoms,
and call it progress when the dust rises again.
The moon knows our stories better than the census,
It counts our ghosts more faithfully than our governments.

Who are we,

when our gods now scroll through timelines?
Even the sacred now needs passwords.
When our children baptize their dreams
In Wi-Fi and war?

We are the distance between memory and invention,

half proverb, half password.
Our laughter travels in the dialect of endurance,
Our grief wears an agbada to church.

In Kaduna's harmattan, our shadows speak Hausa.
In Lagos rain, our hope smells of diesel and salt.
We are still the river that refuses to dry,
even when the sky forgets our name.

Our bones are archives.
Our scars are signatures.
We are borrowed English dreaming in Hausa,
broken Yoruba still humming home.
We are markets and metaphors,
noise and nostalgia,

a continent of mirrors, smudged by history.

Who are we?

We are the question that keeps surviving.
We are clay learning to forgive the fire,
and flame forgiving the form.

Our story is not finished,
We write on wind and wall,
line by line,

with breath that refuses translation.

To know Kindness

You'd have to watch your world dissolve
into a pile of broken bones and then lose it
To a bird ferrying them with its beak across the sea to rebuild its nest
Your favourite cat goes missing
The grocery store downtown folds up because
Their customers have fled the country
& soon the town becomes a ghost of memories

Every day the little boy guides his blind father
around the market begging for alms
But no eye pays them heed or the empty bowl in the boy's hand
What should come first, the shredded wall or the parched lips begging for water?
Everything is marked by time

Watch the girl on the train stare
at the boy sapping on his ice cream with relish
& notice how his face dissolves into pity as he extends it to her
As his mother scolds him with her eyes and pulls him towards herself

There's so much grief in the world—brothers losing sisters, husbands separated
From their wives during war 
but I sit with my phone on a Saturday morning,
munching a soulless pie and watching a boring soap opera
And combing through my friend's Instagram feed, missing a life that was

Pried from my grasp like a tender vine from the earth
Sometimes I flinch on a busy street, in the swirl of bodies
Brushing past me, like a ship in the belly of the sea
When a stranger leans in to hand my fallen scarf to me

My gratitude becomes fired clay trapped in my mouth and the
Confused man leaves without a word
My mother sits all day in front of the television.
She doesn't face me when I tiptoe across
The room, like a mouse because I don't want to disrupt the sprawling silence.
She calls me Yūsuf when I plant a kiss on her forehead and inhale

The dew of old age and pomade in her greying hair.
I let her run her fingers down my face, her face splitting in a smile as
I assume the status of my dead brother
But the smile dissolves and her voice calcify,
you are not Yūsuf, you're not my boy

She almost arrives at a breaking, her voice thinning into tears when I gather her
In my arms and serenade her with songs until she falls asleep
But this is not the version of the story the media shows you
The pain of carrying a loss so great it hunches you
Strips you of agency and leaves you floating and floating

Buoyed on the fragile wings of survival
And yet, nobody teaches you how to come back
from the loss of a father, a brother
A doting grandmother & the world just moves on
Like nothing happened

Perhaps that's the curse of war; not the carnage, not the properties ruined
Not the media reducing dead bodies into mere statistics
As though they were not formally people with souls and dreams
But the silence of palms folding under the table

What better way to butter grief than to turn your back to a wailing child?
Like the sun, I am reminded that the dead live in dogeared photographs,
in the silence of walls reduced to dust in the shadows frittering back and forth
between the pantry and the living room,
when the nights become longer
and your bed brims with memories of the street of Darfur,
the laughter of children echoing
through walls, in conversations held under swaying trees
In the muezzin's cry for prayer,

In the palm of a country that cuddles and pokes you. The store attendant's
gaze lingering at me for too long as I receive the meds for my mother,
as though I am a foreign thing,
As though determined to disrobe me
To sponge me clean of my faith

The British girl in physics class, who mispronounces my name every time,
Amia, instead of Amira
and apologizes as if my heart was made for torture and shame
Because Allah is all beneficent and merciful

To know kindness,
You'd have to experience pain, rejection, watch what you love
Grow still and cold and colourless.
