        i was never meant to say anything.
        i was supposed to watch the fruits
        grow in the garden full of snakes.
        i was bitten today.  yesterday,
        i took a cyborg to my country
        for sightseeing & told him to zip
        his mouth about the rotten
        fruits. his cheeks still hold
        a warning tag from the last visit.
        at the lab, wanting to hide the scar,
        i told the prosthetic to cover
        the cyborg’s cheeks with my country's
        coat of arm—the eagle on the top
        & the two horses posing on both sides.
        i understand little about dishonesty
        but i know the genesis of surviving
        in the realm of a political nightmare
        is to eat from the rotten fruits
        or embrace the holiness of silence.
        i & the cyborg—since we arrived
        my country, have been fasting,
        abstaining from our blue-coated tongue.
        when it was time for the cyborg
        to depart home, i formatted his memory
        because the ears between politics & truth
        is deaf & i do not want another cyborg's chip to rust.
        i swear, i do not want to blame my countrymen
        but who hasn’t eaten from the garden, me?`,

        The thin line between love and hate pitched
        Its tent in your eyes on the day the phoenix
        Broke its wings and fell from the clouds, lying
        Just two metres from the barricades of your heart.
        I remember you crushing little rocks against your
        Shadowed cave of a body in a bid to exonerate your
        Conscience from the flames of a mass of dancing fire.
        My mother used to tell me that hatred is no friend of
        Any man. Now I not only immerse myself in the ice lakes
        Of the territory, I also steal some warmth from the fireplace;
        I not only enjoy the swish and swoops of the tingling air, I also
        Communicate with the ancient pillars of the earth. These four
        Elements altogether no longer bear grudges with one another in
        My world, just like the way the words from my poetry hug and
        Stick to the corners of your smile. I was the art in all your science

    I sit in a history class, my teacher teaches colonialism, imperialism and terrorism
    Terrorist with names and skin color like mine, not so black, yet still black
    It brings me back to the state of my country
    The divide, across religion, ethnicity and class
    My Igbo friend still laments about Biafra
    My christian friend talks about terrorist attacks
    He says it as though he's being targeted simply for not being Muslim
    He says "Boko Haram" with so much disgust as though their actions describes all Muslims
     
    I wish I could tell him,  that I too am a victim, that Muslims too are victims
    In my hometown 30 people were  burnt alive
    That just like Deborah another Muslim was KILLED for blasphemy
    A victim of jungle justice
    I wonder if it's still terrorism if they attack people with names, faces and religion like theirs
     
    In my country we carry trauma like our birthright
    Each religion finding blame
    Each tribe pointing fingers at another
    Intense divide, stereotypes and tribal wars
    Hausas are Aboki, uneducated and almajiri's
    Yorubas are extreme and loud
    Igbos are cheats who love money
    Arguing which is greater, Hausa, Yoruba or Igbo
     
    While doing so we forget that Nigeria is more than that
    It's home to more than 500 languages and 300 ethnic groups
    And  we're all connected, it's all the same
    Stereotyping NIgerians is alot like trying to fit an ocean in a tea cup or
     containing a wildfire in a single match or even trying to bottle up the brilliance of a rainbow
     
    To be  Nigerian is to embrace a beautiful mosaic of diversity
    where each piece contributes to the richness of our identity
    A constant reminder of the heritage that runs through our veins
    -ONE NIGERIA- is more than a chant and greater than a dream
    It's a generation trying to bridge the gaps between words and emotions,
    Attempting to capture the vastness of love in a single label - NIGERIAN-
    Breaking down barriers like a flowing stream, fostering diversity and promoting unity
    Tribes and religions intertwined, weaving a fabric that's one of a  kind
     
    Each step we take, each action we choose, holding the power to shape the future
    And contribute to the healing and growth of our nation
    Years from now, when stories are shared of past struggles and how we repaired. 
    The tales of ethnic fights and intolerance will seem like distant echoes, lost in the expanse,
    Generations to come will find it hard to believe, that such divisions and conflicts were once conceived,
    For we will have built bridges, strong and true
    In this future we envision, when generations hear of our past
     They'll find it hard to believe, because it's no longer a reality
    As we gaze ahead to the future, history casts its gaze upon us, and the present rests in our hands.`,

    The Almajiri is the most visible tragedy seen on the
    streets of all northern Nigerian cities and beyond
    —February 18, 2022, Vanguard News

    I've never seen God more closely

                        than in the eyes of the man who gives

    a penny of softness to a boy.

                        The man lifts the windows of his imaan

    & offer his hand into what

                        another will call sadaqah. Even in

    stillness, it doesn't take

                        much to understand how it is enough

    to heal the hunger of the

                        boy & his fragile body. It takes more

    than one stretched hand to

                        name kindness. I have live here for a

    while, & this is how I remind

                        myself the city’s tenderness is only the

    unfolding of its landscape.

                        Its blue winged history perching on
                        
    everything it touches.

                        The scent of the air thickened with

    the blood & scent of its

                        people. Boned-dusk in the voice of

    the adhaan—gathering a

                        congregation of believers. The boy
                          
    is sitting in front of the

                        mosque. His bowl, tied with a rope,

    is still craving what will

                        quench its new thirst. I am searching
                        
    for windows that open to

                        love in my pocket. I, too, have grown

    to envy what my hand

                        could offer. Like the boy, I, too, prefer

    a god who makes no promise

                        beyond the one that says at the end

    of my misery, there's a door the

                        size of the hand that will do the opening.

    –Daily Trust (Wed, 4 Dec 2024 )

                                            what does survival feels like for you? 
    
    i have seen what it looks like to carry the grave 
    as a hollowed heartbeat. outside my window,
    bullets are flying around; blood is swallowing the
    city whole. yesterday, the parents of the girl who
    had my mother’s eyes visited our house, to take a photograph
    of my mother; to help identify their daughter’s corpse from
    a hundred others piling the market square like bags of millet.
    i muttered prayers, wondering if God heard them. 
    somehow, i believe God still hears
    though our cries never made it to his ears. 
    
                                            won’t you run out of the city for your safety?
    
    iya wajen da gudu ya kaimu shine kabari,
    the distance between us and escape is a bullet away. 
    everywhere is an unopened tab in the website of doom. 
    the Lakurawa people threaten to kill any farmer who visits their field. 
    schools are closed, markets shut down. 
    the only moving thing roaming the city 
    is hunger, and a silence that sings back to itself. 
    
                                            what have you witnessed in the body of the smoke when the bomb strikes?
    
    na gan jini, kogin jini.
    flood of blood. of children wallowing in 
    the helplessness of fate. children feeding on the 
    innocence of tears. their fucked breaths causing
    traffic in the oesophagus of bliss. children leaping like frogs. 
    confluence of silence. women menstruating in fire. 
    women pregnant with the cosmos of rust. prayers. 
    wingless prayers. prayers damned by the holy hands of gravity.
    i saw regret in the eyes of an almajiri boy who lay two limbs incomplete,
    blaming faith or fate or perhaps, both; for his misfortune. 
    
    
                                            what does escape taste like?
    
    it tastes the mesmerizing voices of ghosts. 
    it tastes like silence. 
    it tastes the sacrificial egg in the calabash of djinns. 
    it tastes like a mother bathing her son’s corpse with tears.
    it tastes the voice of a three year-old boy shouting to his
    father’s remains  baba ka tashi, ka tashi muje gida baba
    before the bullet silenced him into a slow fade.

    Light falls through a woman’s veil, and I pick them up 
    with both eyes. There is a realm below the clouds;
    a bus melts away in its arms. 
    The veiled woman is hawking grace, so I swallow 
    my haggling tongue as she greets me with a village
    beside her smile. She is speaking the language my mouth 
    does not understand. The driver who carried ghosts inside his stories
    about the north, throws an insult into the skin of Kontagora.
    Its breath crashes by the roadside. Theory says it was
    murdered by petals: too much of beauty can drown a spirit.
    I say it’s grace: drought has lost the map to this place.
    I trace the footprints of angels in her tongue; she speaks of her people
    as stars. She speaks of a hope that stings darkness on its cheek.
    The sky a polygraph nods in consensus. 
    I kiss her palm before the bus turns its back on her.
    Tradition says it is what to do when you find grace— leave it 
    on your lips. When we run into three cities fathered by the same consonant,
    I imagine God chuckling at the sight of Adam’s northern accent, 
    as he touches these blue cities, say Kaduna say Kano say Katsina.
    I imagine my country burning on His lips as he divides the land,  
    the brown cake, and blesses Arewa with the largest chunk.
    I say it’s grace. And I am dizzy from kissing it into memory.
    
    At home, I unpack my mind into star shaped boxes.
    Tradition says it is what to do after holding constellations.

    On Fridays, Muntari loads his dates into his barrow:
    Business, he says, is a date with a prescribed fate
    
    Maktub! It is all written already. The mullah in his Khutbah
    says life is hardly about the moolah, that money
    
    
    is mere currency, by which he means to say, only
    of worth in the current: the sheen on the coins
    
    subject to rust. I am no expert in the date business,
    in the margin of the profit, but often, I catch Muntari
    
    fingering through the heap for the juiciest Khandari dates,
    the ones plump but faintly wrinkled, stuffing them
    
    into the cupped palms of waiting boys. Once a customer
    stopped by his absent neighbour’s pile of dates.
    
    One would think, and rightly so, that it is fair game
    to hawk down on the chance, clench claws on the client
    
    Call it naiveté & Muntari would scarcely pay any mind,
    but like a gingered apprentice, he transacted on behalf
    
    of his neighbour, tucked the cash in the bands around
    the barrow, & returned empty-handed to his shed.
    
    Or so one would think. That his hands must always be empty, 
    until you watch him pushing his barrow steadily 
    
    
    into the crimson sunset, a halo around his figure 
    like a vignette, with boys in the angwa trailing him
    
    offering to push, tender hands  in his callused palms,

    of northern men shaping love in their hands,
    their words heavy with promise.

    I must be the prayer answered,
    because I am everything this land raised me to be.
    Seasons bear their fruit,
    and with each fruit, the seed of something more.
    I am the seed.

    It is harmattan.
    My home cradles loved men,
    steadfast women, and prayers carved into the air.
    The one thing they love more than God Himself
    is being right—
    even when it’s wrong.

    The morning adhaan cuts through the haze,
    its call threading through the fog
    that wraps this city like a second skin.

    Still, they gather—their shoulders draped in soft cloth,
    feet bare against the cold ground,
    breath visible as they move forward,
    their prayers, rising with the mist.
    Tea kettles hum over coal fires,
    their steam curling upward,
    a quiet offering to the waking sky.

    The air, thick with dust and devotion,
    holds its stories in the cold;
    each step toward the mosque
    etches faith against the blur of dawn.

    where harmattan humbles and heals,
    where every voice rises like poetry,
    strong against the winds of time.
    The people stand like millet
    in the harmattan wind,
    bending but unbroken.
